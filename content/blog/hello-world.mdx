## What You'll Find Here

Our blog features a modern, responsive design with powerful content capabilities:

<Alert type="info">
This blog supports rich content with custom React components, syntax highlighting, and more!
</Alert>

## Code Examples with Syntax Highlighting

Here's a simple JavaScript example with **beautiful syntax highlighting**:

```javascript
function greetVisitor(name) {
  const message = `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to our blog.`
  console.log(message)
  return message
}

// Usage
greetVisitor("World")
```

And here's some Python with **proper highlighting**:

```python
def greet_visitor(name):
    """Greet a visitor with a personalized message."""
    message = f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to our blog."
    print(message)
    return message

# Usage
greet_visitor("World")
```

TypeScript also works perfectly:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string
  email: string
}

function createUser(name: string, email: string): User {
  return { name, email }
}

const user = createUser("John Doe", "john@example.com")
```

## Custom Components

We support custom React components in our content:
